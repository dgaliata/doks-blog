<div class="intro-section">

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **David Galiata**, a Security Engineering Director based in **Petaluma, California**. I have a passion for all things **cybersecurity** and **cloud engineering**. With over **15 years** of IT experience, I've built and operated secure, large-scale systems for enterprise environments.

My expertise spans **cloud infrastructure**, **network security**, and **systems consulting**. I hold several industry certifications including **CISM**, **CCSP**, **CCAK**, and multiple **AWS credentials**.

This blog serves as a platform for sharing insights and knowledge I've gained throughout my career in cybersecurity. I believe that writing and sharing technical concepts is not only beneficial for others but also helps solidify my own understanding.

My superpower is learning new technologies quickly, allowing me to adapt to security challenges and provide effective solutions.

I greatly appreciate comments and thoughts on my posts.
