When I first started learning Python, I found myself constantly Googling the basics. I'd make a little progress here and there, but found myself stuck on simple, quick items. I think it's because a lot of examples use random numbers and lists, etc. that didn't stick with me. As a huge Nintendo and Mario fan, I created this fun cheatsheet that explains Python concepts using examples from Mario Bros.

## Data Types

```python
# Numbers
coins = 42            # integer
jump_height = 3.14    # float
star_power = 1 + 2j   # complex number

# Strings
character = "Mario"   # can use single or double quotes
mario_quote = """
It's-a me,
Mario!
"""

# Booleans
has_mushroom = True
is_small = False

# None type
empty_block = None    # represents absence of value
